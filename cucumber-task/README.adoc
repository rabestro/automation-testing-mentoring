Adopt the previous home task (WebDriver project with patterns implemented) to make possible test execution with Cucumber-JVM. Follow relevant configuration steps for jUnit/TestNg depending on the existing project architecture.

== Acceptance Criteria
1. At least one test should use *"Scenario Outline"* keyword and *“Examples:”* section.
2. Apply *“Background”* keyword for preconditions/recurrent steps.
3. Use filtering/regular expressions in Gherkin step definitions for parametrization and flexibility.
