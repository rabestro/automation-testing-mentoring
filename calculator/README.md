# Automated Testing Mentoring with Java

## Java: Testing with JUnit

### Objective:

As a basis for this home task, use Calculator-1.0.jar

Write unit tests for the calculator jar  library (Calculator-1.0.jar)
* Add Calculator-1.0.jar to your project reference;
* Write tests using any testing framework (JUnit or TestNG);
* Each class should test only one method of the library;
* Tests pre-conditions and post-conditions should be implemented with appropriate annotations;
* Run tests in IDE;
* Create parametrized tests (data-driven approach);
* Configure and execute tests in parallel mode.

### Acceptance criteria
1. [x] A separate Unit Test class exists for each method of Calculator-1.0.jar;
2. [x] JUnit or TestNG is used in home task;
3. [x] Tests have pre-conditions and post-conditions;
4. [x] Screenshots with results of running in IDE are available;
5. [x] For TestNG only: Xml configuration exists for suite. This configuration allows use/run group of tests;
6. [x] Data-driven approach is demonstrated with test framework features;
7. [x] Parallel execution of tests is demonstrated with test framework features.
#### BONUS TASK
* [x] Calculator-1.0.jar contains couple of defects. Each found and reported defect gives you +0,1 as a bonus
