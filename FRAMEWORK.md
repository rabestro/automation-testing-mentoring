# Automation Framework

## Practical Task
Develop an automation framework for the [Hardcore task](selenium-task-4) in WebDriver.
The final framework should include the following:

1. [x] A WebDriver manager for managing browser connectors
2. [ ] Page Object/Page Factory for page abstractions
3. [ ] Models for business objects of the required elements
4. [ ] Property files with test data for at least two different environments
5. [ ] XML suites for smoke tests and other tests
6. [ ] A screenshot with the date and time is taken if the test fails.
7. [ ] The framework should include an option for running with Jenkins and browser parameterization, test suite, and environment.
8. [ ] Test results should be displayed on the job chart, and the screenshots should be archived as artefacts.
